# Real Estate Digital Services

The [_Real Estate Digital Services_](https://gifted-montalcini-b706ed.netlify.com/) website is a First Milestone project build for [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Developer Course.

## The Brief

A _Real Estate Digital Services_ company that specialise in Real Estate Photography and Videography is looking to promote their business and showcase their craft online. The company requires a website that will reach new clients and make the service booking a quick and pleasant experience.
 
## UX

The UX process played a crucial role in the design of the _Real Estate Digital Services_ website whether it was an initial task of identifying users and determining their needs, deciding on the structure or selecting a visual language. 

### Strategy and Scope

The primary target audiences are the potential clients who wish to use the site to check available services, see recent work and book an appointment in order to put their property on the market, sell their property faster or increase the property value. 

Furthermore, the business owners would like to use the site to showcase their skills and experience by providing examples of their best work. They would like as well display all available services and demonstrate their availability for work.

Based on the above brief the following user stories were identified:
 
**User Stories (Client)**:

- As a user _A_, I want to see Photographs of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _B_, I want to watch Videos of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _C_, I want to see Interactive Panoramic view of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _D_, I want to see Aerial view of real estate so that I can verify the service. 
- As a user _E_, I want to go through all available services so that I can choose the one that fulfil my needs.
- As a user _F_, I want to book a service so that I can have my listing advertised asap.
- As a user _G_, I want to get in touch with the business owner whether by phone or email so that I can discuss the services.
- As a user _H_, I want to see some testimonials so that I can verify the quality of the service.
- As a user _I_, I want to read description and understand all available services so that I can choose the one that fulfil my needs.

**User Stories (Business Owner)**:

- As a user _J_, I want to show my portfolio to visitors so that I can get more clients.
- As a user _K_, I want to allow potential clients to quickly and easy book a service online so that I can get more business that way.
- As a user _L_, I want to invite visitors to my social accounts so that I can increase my online presence and reach new potential clients.

### Structure and Skeleton

Due to the business requirements and services characteristics, the site design should be minimal and aesthetic as too much clutter would distract the user from the website's main purpose. The website's simplicity and its responsive structure will provide functionality and intuitive interactions for the users.

The following wireframes were created in order to provide a starting point for the website skeleton:

- <a href="Wireframes/small_device.jpg" target="_blank">Small device</a>
- <a href="Wireframes/medium_device.jpg" target="_blank">Medium device</a>
- <a href="Wireframes/large_device.jpg" target="_blank">Large device</a>

### Surface

Once the wireframes were in place, the following visuals were introduced:

- The base colors for the site are dark blue/purple and white. These colors were carefully selected based on the color psychology and aesthetics. The color blue is associated with knowledge and trust while color white with virtue and cleanliness. Both colors reflects the business characteristics.
- Typography is limited to two main typefaces that are sans serif which makes them readable on both mobile and larger devices. The mentioned typefaces are Roboto and Work Sans. The other typeface is Abril Fatface but it is only used once on the landing page. All typefaces are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The website logos are custom made to reflect the services and make the site memorable.
- The website assets include video and photographs, some delivered by client and others taken from stock photography where necessary. They were carefully selected to be self explanatory in order to help in website navigation. 

## Features

There are three main elements on the website that are common for all of the five pages, i.e. _header (navigation)_, _main content_ and _footer_.

### Header (navigation)

The header (navigation) consists of business logotype and navigation bar that changes its appearance from collapsing vertical menu on small devices to horizontal on larger ones. The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page to make it accessible at all times and help visitors navigate on the site. The logotype element has a link to the home page allowing users to go back when needed. The navigation bar menu elements that consists of _home_, _services_, _online booking_, _about_ and _contact_ page, have links to the their particular pages and all change their appearance on the mouse hover allowing user to quick and easy navigate through them. The currently visited page is clearly marked by a underline element.

### Main Content

The main content differ between the web pages with an exception to the main image. All of the web pages have a "hero" image (or video on home page) that visually bond with the page content.

The _landing page_ (_home_) feature a promotional video of a real estate that covers either all or most of the viewport, depending on the device. Below the video, the user will find some short sentences describing the company and a list of all available services. Each service block consists of a logo, name and brief description. Each elements of that blocks are linked to the services page that provides further information. The closing element on the home page content is a real estate image providing a glimpse of the company's photography skills.

The _services_ page feature an landscape image of properties and short introduction. The main part of the page consists of available services blocks made of service logo, name and description. Each service block has a sample media element at the bottom of the block, providing a visual overview of the particular service, whether it is a Photograph, Video, Aerial Image or 360&deg; Interactive Panorama.

The _online booking_ page feature an image of a person holding a phone and a short description about the page. The main element of the page is a form that requires user input in order to schedule a service appointment for selected service or services. The form consists of checkboxes, clearly label input fields which prevents users from inserting incorrect characters or submitting form without valid information and a self explanatory "submit" button.

The _about_ page feature an image of a camera lens, a short sentence with bullet points outlining the reasons behind the exceptional service and clients testimonials as a proof of quality service.

The _contact_ page feature an image of a "open" sign and short sentence stating the company availability for work. The main part of the page consists of a phone number and email address, with both being activated when clicked on allowing for effortless and instant contact via phone or email. The third way of contact is through an online form which consists of a input fields and "submit" button. 

### Footer

The footer elements of the website consists of a sentence encouraging users to book a property photo shoot with the company and provides a link to the online booking form. The link is allocated to a "book online" button with its design features making it clearly visible on the page. The users will find as well all the links to the social media that the company has its presence at. The social media links are in form of icons directly related to their brands. The last element is a link to web developer portfolio page. The button, social media icons and the web developer elements change their appearance on hover for better user interaction. The footer elements of the website are consistent throughout the page with an exception to the _online booking_ page where the encouraging sentence and button are replace with gratitude sentence.

All of the website contents are responsive and resize nicely based on the device sizes. All text elements are centred and spaced evenly for better readability. The visual design is consistent across all the pages.

## Testing

During the website development stage I have conducted two types of testing, manual and automated. The manual testing was ongoing throughout the whole development stage while the automated test was run when the project was at its finish.

### Manual Testing

The manual testing consisted mainly of the following technologies/tools:

- Chrome DevTools

Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. This tools allows me to instantly preview and edit my pages but I was mainly using it to diagnose problems and fix them quickly. 

- Web browsers:
	+ Chrome
	+ Firefox
	+ Safari
	+ Internet Explorer

I made sure to use browser prefixes where necessary but to make sure that there are no errors with the website I was doing a cross browser testing from time to time. It basically consisted of running the site on these browsers, changing the size of the browser window and where possible using the native developer tools to check site responsiveness and functionality. These tests were run on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

- Devices:
	+ desktop
	+ tablet
	+ mobile

I run a manual testing on few types of devices whenever I had a chance but mainly I was testing the webiste using desktop, tablet and mobile phone, so I could cover the most popular screen sizes.

- Operating Systems:
	+ macOS / iOS
	+ Android

The Device testing part consisted of running the website on following Operating Systems - macOS, iOS and Android.

- User Stories Testing

The following user stories from the UX section were tested to make sure everything work as intended.

1. Users "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "I" & "J" wants to see examples of either one or all of the available services and read about each of them. The following steps needs to be conduct in that case:
    1. Go to the "Services" page and scroll to the service of choice, or
    2. From "Home" page click/tap on the name, logo or short description of the service of interest to verify that the link redirects to the selected service on the "Services" page.

#### Manual Testing Bugs

The only significant issue I encountered during the manual testing was related to the video on iphone. The video failed to play. After some research I managed to make it work by changing the video settings suitable to iphone requirements and changing the html attributes of video tag. 

### Automate Testing

The automate testing was conduct using the following tools:

- Chrome Lighthouse

The Lighthouse is an open-source automated tool that audits website for performance, accessibility, SEO and more. The website score was constantly satisfactory with recent results as follows:

```
- Performance at 90
- Progressive Web App at 55
- Accessibility at 88
- Best Practices at 88
- SEO at 78

highest score is 100
```

In order to run the Lighthouse tool please use the Chrome Developer Tools and locate the Audits tab on the right hand corner of the DevTools window.

- Online Html & Css checker

The above tool was run in order to validate the HTML and CSS semantic and non-semantic elements and check for any potential problems.

In order to run the checker please use the following [link](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and paste the code in.

#### Automated Testing Bugs

There were no significant issues during the automated testing. The low DevTools audit score for the Progressive Web App (score at 55) is not really an issue as it relates to more complex web pages that should offer an offline capabilities, push notifications, etc.

## Deployment

The website was deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with the following steps:

1. Connecting & authorizing GitHub account with Netlify.
2. Choosing the site repository.
3. Selecting Branch to deploy.
4. Deploying the website.
