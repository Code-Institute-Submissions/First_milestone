# Real Estate Digital Services

The _Real Estate Digital Services_ website is a First Milestone project build for [Code Institute's](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Developer Course.

## The Brief

A _Real Estate Digital Services_ company that specialise in Real Estate Photography and Videography is looking to promote their business and showcase their craft online. The company requires a website that will reach new clients and make the service booking a quick and pleasant experience.
 
## UX

The UX process played a crucial role in the design of the _Real Estate Digital Services_ website whether it was a initial task of identifing users and determining their needs, deciding on the structure or selecting a visual language. 

### Strategy and Scope

The primary target audiences are the potential clients who wish to use the site to check available services, see recent work and book an appointment in order to put their property on the market, sell their property faster or increase the property value. 

Furthermore, the business owners would like to use the site to showcase their skills and experience by providing examples of their best work. They would like as well display all available services and demonstrate their availability for work.

Based on the above brief the following user stories were identified:
 
**User Stories (Client)**:

- As a user _A_, I want to see Photographs of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _B_, I want to watch Videos of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _C_, I want to see Interactive Panoramic view of real estate so that I can verify the service.
- As a user _D_, I want to see Aerial view of real estate so that I can verify the service. 
- As a user _E_, I want to go through all available services so that I can choose the one that fulfill my needs.
- As a user _F_, I want to book a service so that I can have my listing advertised asap.
- As a user _G_, I want to get in touch with the business owner whether by phone or email so that I can discuss the services.
- As a user _H_, I want to see some testimonials so that I can verify the quality of the service.
- As a user _I_, I want to read description and understand all available services so that I can choose the one that fulfill my needs.

**User Stories (Business Owner)**:

- As a user _J_, I want to show my portfolio to visitors so that I can get more clients.
- As a user _K_, I want to allow potential clients to quickly and easy book a service online so that I can get more business that way.
- As a user _L_, I want to invite visitors to my social accounts so that I can increase my online presence and reach new potential clients.

### Structure and Skeleton

Due to the business requirements and services characteristics, the site design should be minimal and aesthetic as too much clutter would distract the user from the website's main purpose. The website's simplicity and its responsive structure will provide functionality and intuitive interactions for the users.

The following wireframes were created in order to provide a starting point for the website skeleton:

- <a href="Wireframes/small_device.jpg" target="_blank">Small device</a>
- <a href="Wireframes/medium_device.jpg" target="_blank">Medium device</a>
- <a href="Wireframes/large_device.jpg" target="_blank">Large device</a>

### Surface

Once the wireframes were in place, the following visuals were introduced:

- The base colors for the site are dark blue/purple-ish and white. These colors were carefully selected based on the color psychology and aestetics. The color blue is associated with knowledge and trust while color white with virtue and cleanliness. Both colors reflects the business characteristics.
- Typography is limited to two main typefaces that are sans serif which makes them readable on both mobile and larger devices. The mentioned typefaces are Roboto and Work Sans. The other typeface is Abril Fatface but it is only used once on the landing page. All typefaces are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The website logos are custom made to reflect the services and make the site memorable.
- The website assets include video and photographs, some delivered by client and others taken from stock photography where neccessery. They were carefully selected to be self explanatory in order to help in website navigation. 

## Features

There are three main elements on the website that are common for all of the five pages, i.e. _header (navigation)_, _main content_ and _footer_.

### Header (navigation)

The header (navigation) consists of business logotype and navigation bar that changes its appearance from collapsing vertical menu on small devices to horizontal on larger ones. The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page to make it accessible at all times and help visitors navigate on the site. The logotype element has a link to the home page allowing users to go back when needed. The navigation bar menu elements that consists of _home_, _services_, _online booking_, _about_ and _contact_ page, have links to the their particular pages and all change their appearance on the mouse hover allowing user to quick and easy navigate through them. The currently visited page is clearly marked by a underline element.

### Main Content

The _landing page_ (_home_) feature a promotional video of a real estate that covers either all or most of the viewport, depending on the device. Below the video, the user will find some short sentences describing the company and a list of all available services. Each service block consists of a logo, name and brief description. Each elements of that blocks are linked to the services page that provides further information. The closing element on the home page content is a real estate image providing a glimpse of the company's photography skills.

The _online booking_ page feature an image of a person holding a phone and a short description about the page. The main element of the page is a form that requires user input in order to schedule a service appointment for selected service or services. The form consists of checkboxes, clearly labeld input fields which prevents users from inserting incorrect characters or submitting form without valid information and a selfexplanatory "submit" button.

The _about_ page feature an image of a camera lens, a short sentence with bulletpoints outlining the reasons behind the exceptional service and clients testimonials as a proof of quality service.

The _contact_ page feature an image of a "open" sign and short sentence stating the company availability for work. The main part of the page consists of a phone number and email address, with both being activated when clicked on allowing for effortless and instant contact via phone or email. The third way of contact is through a online form which consists of a input fields and "submit" button. 

### Footer

The footer elements of the website consists of a sentence encouraging users to book a property photo shoot with the company and provids a link to the online booking form. The link is allocated to a "book online" button with its design features making it clearly visible on the page. The users will find as well all the links to the social media that the company has its presence at. The social media links are in form of icons directly related to their brands. The last element is a link to web developer portfolio page. The button, social media icons and the web developer elements change their appearance on hover for better user interaction. The footer elements of the website are consistant through out the page with an exception to the _online booking_ page where the encouraging sentence and button are replace with gratitude sentence.

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

## Deployment

<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->
